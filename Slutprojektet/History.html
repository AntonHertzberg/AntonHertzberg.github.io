                <div class="historytext">
                    In late 1886, a gaggle of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament Factory decided to form a football team. They called themselves Dial Square as a reference to the sundial atop the entrance to the factory.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    On December 11, 1886, Dial Square romped to a 6-0 victory over Eastern Wanderers; the first game in their initial guise. Shortly afterwards the name ‘Royal Arsenal’ was adopted.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    A group of players from Nottingham Forest joined the Club and this connection with the future European Cup winners would spawn Arsenal’s famous red shirts. The group approached their former club, who had been formed some 20 years earlier, for spare kit. Forest duly obliged and Arsenal, dipped in red, never looked back.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Arsenal floated between a handful of different pitches in the Plumstead area in their early years. They started life on Plumstead Common but, for their second season, Royal Arsenal rented the nearby Sportsman Ground on Plumstead Marshes. It was here that the Club would enter the London Senior Cup for the first time. Although they were beaten by Barnes in Round Two the wheels were in motion. With increasing support, the Club rented the Manor Ground the following season.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Royal Arsenal’s first FA Cup appearance would take place here in 1889/90. During the same season Arsenal would secure a hat-trick of successes, winning the London Charity Cup, the Kent Senior Cup and the Kent Junior Cup. The Club were on the move once again the following year, this time to the Invicta Ground, where they would stay for nearly six years.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    An overall increase in playing success meant only one thing for the Arsenal – professionalism. This shocked football authorities and the Club were expelled from the London FA and boycotted by many southern clubs. During the same close season, the club changed their name to Woolwich Arsenal.<br>
                    An increase in rent at the Invicta Ground meant that Arsenal had to move back to their old Manor Ground home, which they purchased outright; this would be the Club’s home until their move to Highbury in 1913. Shortly afterwards, their application to the Football League’s Second Division was successful.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Arsenal’s success was steady throughout the latter part of the 19th century and their league position improved until they achieved promotion to Division One in 1903. Three years later they reached the Semi-Final of the FA Cup two seasons running. However, Plumstead was not the ideal site for Arsenal and with the financial situation worsening and relegation threatening, up stepped Fulham chairman Henry Norris.
                    Norris recognised the need for a move, ear-marking Highbury as a suitable site. And, after relegation in 1913, the Club moved to its new home. Within two years of the move, ‘Woolwich’ was dropped from their title and the Club became known as ‘Arsenal FC’.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    At the end of World War One the First Division was increased by two clubs, of which Arsenal were one. And under the guidance of new manager Leslie Knighton, Arsenal spent the first six seasons of peacetime achieving some moderate success. Chairman Norris wanted more and, in 1925, he advertised for a new manager.
                    One particular applicant, a Yorkshireman by the name of Herbert Chapman, would change the Club forever.
                </div>
                <div id="chapman">Herbert Chapman</div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    When Henry Norris decided that Arsenal needed a new manager in the summer of 1925, he could never have anticipated the impact of his next appointment.
                    Herbert Chapman, who had won the FA Cup and two Division One titles with Huddersfield Town in the early Twenties, agreed to join the Gunners in the summer of 1925.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    After flirting with relegation in the previous season, Chapman set about reinventing the Club with almost immediate effect. In his first season at Highbury, the new manager steered the Gunners to an FA Cup Quarter Final and a second-place finish in the First Division; the highest league placing in their history.
                    Within a year, Arsenal had reached their first FA Cup Final on April 23, 1927. However that day is remembered for another reason; it was the first and only time that the FA Cup has left England, as Cardiff City secured a 1-0 victory in front of 91,206 at Wembley.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    However, Chapman would only have to wait another three years to bring the famous trophy to Highbury, ironically overcoming Huddersfield Town at Wembley in 1930. The triumph signalled the start of Arsenal’s prolonged dominance of English football and, with the likes of Alex James and Cliff Bastin in the ranks, Arsenal became the envy of the football world.
                    Within a season the Club romped to its first ever league title, racking up a record-breaking 66 points in the process. Only the FA Charity Shield was scooped in 1931/32 despite Arsenal coming within touching distance of both the League title and the FA Cup; eventually the Gunners would finish two points behind Everton and go down 1-0 against Newcastle in the FA Cup final at Wembley.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Arsenal weren’t to be starved of title success for too long though and the Club duly lifted the Division One title the following season, wearing their now famous red shirt with white sleeves for the first time. The achievement was only marred by a shock defeat against Third Division Walsall in the FA Cup.
                    But that disappointment would pale into insignificance next to a tragedy that would stun the Club. In January 1934, after watching an Arsenal Third Team match against Guildford City nursing a cold, Chapman’s condition quickly worsened. Soon afterwards, pneumonia set in. During the early hours of January 6, 1934, Herbert Chapman died at his home in Hendon aged 55.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    However, the tragedy would not spell the end of Arsenal’s success and the Club continued to build on the foundations laid by their late manager. A second successive title was delivered in the following May. And that swiftly became three in a row under the management of ex-director George Allison in 1934/35.
                    No league titles were to follow in the next two years although Arsenal did lift the FA Cup for the second time in their history after a 74th-minute Ted Drake strike secured a 1-0 win for the Gunners over Sheffield United on April, 25 1936.
                    In the penultimate season before the outbreak of World War Two, Arsenal were champions of England once again; their fifth league title in eight seasons.
                </div>
                <div id="post-war">Post-War Arsenal</div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Arsenal returned after the Second World War with the same manager, George Allison, and some of the same players however it was apparent immediately that the magic of the 1930s had long gone. The loss of Cliff Bastin and Ted Drake to retirement seemed too great a burden to shoulder.
                    In fact the side flirted with relegation in the 1946/47 campaign before ending up 13th. 
                    Allison, now in his mid-60s, decided to retire after that campaign. His assistant, Tom Whitaker, took up the reigns and had an immediate effect.
                    In the 1947/48 season, Arsenal won the League by seven points from Manchester United. Two years later, a brace by Reg Lewis against Liverpool would see them win the FA Cup. However, the goalscorer did not take all the plaudits. 
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Allison’s last major contribution at Arsenal had been to bring Joe Mercer to the club. The bandy-legged left-half would turn out to be an inspired signing. Mercer would go to make 275 appearances for Arsenal before suffering a double fracture of his leg in a collision with team-mate Joe Wade against Liverpool on April 10, 1954.<br>
                    However the 1950 FA Cup Final against the Anfield side would be perhaps his finest hour for Arsenal. Mercer had not moved to London after his transfer to Highbury, instead he retained his grocer’s shop in Wallesey and commuted down for games. During the week he trained with Liverpool but naturally had to sit out certain sessions on Merseyside ahead of the Final.
                    Mercer galvanised Whitaker’s side into a major footballing force in the early 1950s. In 1951/52, Arsenal were in contention for a Double but ended up empty-handed.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    They finished four points off champions Manchester United in the League and to lost George Robledo’s goal when they met Newcastle in the FA Cup Final. Though it might have been very different if had Wally Barnes had not picked up an early injury. These were the days when sides did not field substitutes and the full back ended up being a passenger for much of the game.
                    Whitaker’s side recovered to win the title the following year but by the narrowest margin in history. Arsenal and Preston finished the campaign with identical records with the London side taking the honours by 0.099 of a goal on goal average.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    It would be Arsenal’s last trophy for 17 years. The team was growing old and Whitaker could not quite attract major names to the side. After his death in late 1956, the club tried a couple of stalwart players as managers – Jack Crayston and George Swindin. Neither could rekindle former glories. In fact the strongest League finish of that entire 17-year period would be Swindin’s first year when the side finished third. 
                    The club then changed tack and, in 1962, appointed an outsider in Billy Wright. He had been a wonderful captain of Wolves and England (plus a boyhood Arsenal fan) but he had little experience in a managerial role. The side were barely also-rans under Wright however he did sign Bob Wilson, Frank McLintock and Joe Baker. The club’s youth team also won the FA Youth Cup in 1966. The seeds of the Double side were being sown.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    The architect of that triumph, Bertie Mee took over from Wright the same year. The former club physio set about bringing through the likes of Pat Rice, John Radford, Ray Kennedy and Charlie George. His side would end the 60s by reaching – and losing - successive League Cup Finals. However greater glory lay ahead.
                </div>
                <div id="seventies">The seventies</div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    The 1970s started superbly and ended pretty well however the middle years were deeply disappointing.
                    In the late 1960s there was a feeling Arsenal were growing. By the turn of the decade, the FA Youth Cup winning side of 1966 had started to rise into the first-team. They had even come close to silverware in the League Cup Finals of 1968 and 1969. However they needed a breakthrough.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    It would come in Europe. Bertie Mee’s side had a relatively serene run to the Semi-Finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, even putting nine goals past Dinamo Bacau over two legs. They beat the mighty Ajax – Johan Cryuff and all – in the last four but seemed to have blown their chance of lifting the trophy when they trailed 3-0 at Anderlecht in the first leg of the Final. However Ray Kennedy’s late goal gave them a lifeline and they grabbed it with both hands by storming to a 3-0 win on an electric night at Highbury. 
                    Bouyed with confidence, it would be easy to suggest the Double win the following year was always going to happen. Not so.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Arsenal vied with Leeds throughout the League campaign and, such was their proximity, Mee’s side went into their last game knowing a win or a goalless draw would give them the title. A score draw or a defeat and the trophy would end up at Elland Road. And, irony of ironies, the game was at White Hart Lane, home of Arsenal’s fiercest rivals – Tottenham. Ray Kennedy’s late header took the honours, literally.<br>
                    It was Arsenal’s first title for 18 years but, five days later, the team would create real history. Eddie Kelly and, most memorably, Charlie George scored as Mee’s side came from behind to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup Final.
                    They had become only the fourth team in history to do the Double and only the second in the 20th century.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Unfortunately that sunny May afternoon would be the peak of this side. They lost the FA Cup Final to Leeds the following year and would finish second in the League in 1972/73. By now Mee had spent a small fortune on World Cup winner Alan Ball but the side was faltering. They would finish 10th, 16th and 17th in the next three seasons and Terry Neill took the reins in 1976.<br>
                    He bought Pat Jennings from his old side Spurs after spending a club record £333,333.34p to sign Malcolm MacDonald from Newcastle. These additions, along with rising talent like Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, made Arsenal a top-eight side again in the League. However their brightest success would come in the Cups.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Neill’s side reached three successive FA Cup Finals - 1978, 1979 and 1980. The first and the third would be shock 1-0 defeats – to Ipswich and West Ham respectively. The 1979 showpiece would be dubbed the Five-Minute Final because, after seemingly in control at 2-0, Manchester United would draw level with a brace in the closing stages. However Arsenal striker Alan Sunderland would break their hearts and win the Cup by sliding home a goal in injury time.  
                    <br>Neill would find out how United felt. Four days after losing the 1980 Final to West Ham, Arsenal lost on penalties to Valencia in the Final of the Cup Winners’ Cup.
                </div>
                <div id="graham">Graham's Glory Years</div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    In May of their centenary year, Arsenal named former player George Graham as the man to succeed Don Howe, who had asked to be released from his Highbury contract.
                    The Scotsman’s arrival drew a line under a fallow period under Terry Neil and later Howe. After losing both the FA Cup and European Cup Winners’ Cup Finals in 1980, Arsenal lost some of their most established stars at the beginning of the decade. Liam Brady, who had been named Player of the Year three times running, signed for Juventus and then Frank Stapleton moved on to Manchester United. The two departures embodied the passing of an era.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Graham was installed as Arsenal manager after a successful spell at Third Division Millwall. Within a year he had delivered the Club’s first silverware since the FA Cup in 1979. Despite going a goal down to the mighty Liverpool, Graham’s young side won 2-1 to claim Arsenal’s first League Cup. They reached the Final the following year too, but were denied by Luton Town.<br>
                    Graham’s reign was notable for the strict discipline put in place both on and off the pitch. Defensively, Arsenal were second to none and Graham set about building a back four that would serve the Gunners for over a decade, with young captain Tony Adams its centrepiece. Further up the field, the likes of David Rocastle, Paul Merson and Alan Smith provided the Gunners’ attacking threat.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    In his third season in charge, Graham would oversee perhaps the most dramatic title triumph in League history on the final day of the 1988/89 season, with extra-special thanks to Smith and Michael Thomas.
                    The Club’s first Division One triumph for 18 years was expected to usher in a new period of Arsenal dominance in English football, but that wasn’t quite the case. The following season was blemished by inconsistency and a disappointing fourth-place finish was all Graham’s men could muster.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Reinforcements were needed and Swedish midfielder Anders Limpar and a Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper by the name of David Seaman were brought in with immediate effect. Despite a two-point deduction for a mass brawl in a 1-0 win against Manchester United, and an eight-week prison sentence for Adams, Arsenal romped to the Division One crown, losing only once along the way.
                    However, once again Arsenal were unable to build on their league success and a fourth-place finish followed once again in 1992. The league title continued to evade the Club in the following seasons but Arsenal would emerge as a highly-efficient knock-out team.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Their unique FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993 was a testament to that. European honours soon followed when Arsenal overcame Parma in the European Cup Winners Cup Final in Copenhagen a year later; only their second silverware on the continent.
                    However, within 10 months of the victory, Graham was sacked as Arsenal manager. His dismissal brought an end to a quite glittering nine-year spell at Highbury.
                </div>
                <div id="wenger">The Wenger Years</div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Short-term tenures for Stewart Houston and Bruce Rioch followed George Graham’s departure but Arsenal were still in need of a long-term answer. This would be emphatically delivered in the form of a relatively unknown Frenchman who would change the Club forever.<br>
                    Arsène Wenger arrived at Highbury in October 1996 after notable success at Monaco and a stint in charge of Japanese side Grampus Eight. He was the Club’s first boss from outside the UK.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Arsenal finished third that season but the new manager would officially announce his arrival in his first full campaign at the helm. At one stage in 1997/98 the Gunners trailed leaders Manchester United by 11 points. However, imperious form throughout the second half of the campaign saw Arsenal crowned Premier League champions with two games to spare. Within two weeks, the Gunners had added the FA Cup, securing the Double in Wenger’s first full season in charge.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    As well as transforming Arsenal on the pitch, the new manager set about revolutionising his players’ lives away from the pitch, implementing cutting-edge training regimes and dietary systems. The Frenchman was meticulous in his squad construction, adding the likes of Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars to a team already boasting Arsenal institutions like David Seaman, Tony Adams and Dennis Bergkamp.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Another Highbury stalwart who continued to flourish under Wenger was Ian Wright. Already closing in on Cliff Bastin’s all-time goalscoring record when the Frenchman arrived, Wright finally scored his magical 179th goal against Bolton Wanderers on September 13, 1997. In the end, perhaps Wenger’s finest signing to date – Thierry Henry - would eclipse Wright’s tally a little over eight years later.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Henry signed in August 1999, after Arsène Wenger’s side had been denied back-to-back titles by one point by Manchester United in the previous May. At first, the Frenchman’s ability to adapt to the rough-and-tumble of the Premier League was questioned, but after failing to score in his first eight games, the former Juventus star plundered an impressive 26 goals that term. Final defeats in the 2000 Uefa Cup and 2001 FA Cup meant that Henry was still without any Highbury silverware. But not for long.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    In 2001/02, Arsène Wenger’s side would surge to a spectacular Double, finishing seven points clear of Liverpool in the Premier League. They sealed the title with a win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, just days after dispatching Chelsea 2-0 in the FA Cup Final.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Despite lifting the FA Cup once more in 2002/03, back-to-back titles would again elude the Gunners. But they made up for that disappointment in the season that followed, completing an unbeaten title campaign and going on to eclipse Nottingham Forest's long-standing run of League games without defeat. Played 49, Won 36, Drawn 13, Lost None - that Arsenal side was truly 'Invincible'.
                </div>
                <div class="historytext">
                    Wenger had conquered England but Europe still evaded him. A Quarter-Final defeat against Chelsea in 2004 matched the closest Wenger’s Arsenal had come to the biggest prize in European football but that would all change in May 2006 when they went all the way to the Champions League Final in Paris. In between they claimed another FA Cup triumph, beating Manchester United in Cardiff in 2005.
                    Arsenal were quickly becoming one of the most revered sides in Europe. And they underlined their ambition when, in February 2004, construction began on the Gunners' new state-of-the-art home at Ashburton Grove, a stone’s throw from Highbury. The new Emirates Stadium officially opened its doors in the summer of 2006 - a bold step into the future for a Club with a glittering past.
